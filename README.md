# Redux Learning Resource List

The following is a list of resources I found helpful when I was fist learning redux.
I have tried to structure the resources below in an order that could be effective for learning redux.

## 1. forward / Where to start

Learning a new tech can be a huge pain, what i've found most effective for myself is.

## 1: Start out by reading the docs

![1-Why the docs](./imgs/docmeme.png)

    This will help to give you a general idea of what problem the tech is trying to solve and why you might want to use it.
    Core concepts and best practices for using the tech and usually a tutorial and code examples.
    After reading through the docs a bit i'm usually still left with some unaswered questions though..
    Usually somewhere along the lines of how do I implement this new tech into my app and how are other people using this tech in their apps.

## 2: Time to hit the google for some walkthrough tutorials on scotch.io, medium.com, frontendmasters.com or some youtubes

  __Dont skip step 1__
  `“Have patience. All things are difficult before they become easy.” Saadi`

    Almost every article, walkthrough or video you read/watch will use the tech you are trying to learn effectively.
    Which is awesome but they might not explain something the way you need to hear it or they might start out at a higher or lower level then you were
    expecting and you might end up more confused then when you started. This is why i stress starting with the docs above
    a lot of confusion can be avoided by throughly looking through the docs then going onto tutorials.

    It can usually take me reading 1-2 articles _and/or_ watching 2-4 videos for me get a general idea of how best to structure a new tech into my app.
    Be patient with yourself learning a new tech is not easy (especially redux)

## 3: Three words, Apply, Apply, Apply

`“Knowing is not enough, we must apply. Willing is not enough, we must do.” Johann Wolfgang von Goethe`

    reading through docs, articles and watching videos are great to get you up and running with a tech
    but all of that wont do you any good if you don't create your own app with the tech you spent so much
    time learning. heres a few suggestions for you that may help implement the tech. counter app, task app, article app.

    I personally try to implement the tech into a basic auth with routes for signup login and user profile.

## 4: All The Links

### 1: Intoduction Redux docs

below _in order_ is a list of doc links to get you started with redux

### 2: Redux Basic Tutorial

  `In the guide below, you will walk through the process of creating a simple Todo app using redux`

  `read through it, it will give you general idea of how redux works, but it does not show react till the end`

  `remeber redux can be used outside of the react ecosystem (angular, vue, ember to name a few)`

[redux app tutorial](https://redux.js.org/basics/basic-tutorial)

[how to transform the above redux app tutorial to use Reactjs](https://redux.js.org/basics/usage-with-react)

    so the above was nice but i was still kinda confused on how it all fit together.
    i then started going onto articles and videos for answers
    i found a video that was flipping perfect for answering my questions.
    Its a tutorial on building a react app then translating that app from using reactjs state,
    to useing redux. It is incredibly well put together and uses good visual aid tools.
    i'll include the whole link and a link to where he starts using redux.
